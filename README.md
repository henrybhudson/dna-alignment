# DNA Alignment
A project for COMP1051.

## Problem Statement
Given two DNA sequences $X=x_1x_2\dots x_n$ and $Y=y_1y_2\dots y_m$, an alignment is an addition of gaps between letters in order to line up letters from $X$ with letters from $Y$. There are penalties for adding gaps ($P_g$) and mismatching letters ($P_m$). The solution should find a way to create an alignment such that the total penality is minimised.
